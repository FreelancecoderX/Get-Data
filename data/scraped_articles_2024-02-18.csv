Motley Fool,"1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Super Micro Computer Stock Is Going to $1,040. Is It a Buy?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-173000319.html,Supermicro is proving Nvidia isn't the only artificial intelligence stock where investors can make money.,"Data center systems provider Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) has been a darling of Wall Street lately. Its shares have soared 950% over the past year and have been on a parabolic move recently.The stock has tripled in just the last month, but one Wall Street analyst thinks Supermicro, as it is known, still has more room to run. Bank of America Securities analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya began coverage on the supplier of accelerated computing server systems with a buy rating and a $1,040 price target. That would represent a jump of 18% over Wednesday's closing price, even after Supermicro's torrid run.AI has legsCompanies in virtually every sector are leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The biggest beneficiary in the stock market thus far has been semiconductor chipmaker Nvidia. In that company's third quarter, overall revenue more than tripled from a year ago and soared 34% sequentially from the prior quarter. That jump came mainly from growth in Nvidia's data center business thanks to customers craving its chips that power AI applications.But businesses don't just need the chips, they need the server infrastructure that keeps the full AI machine running. And while Nvidia's revenue tripled year over year, its earnings per share rocketed by more than 12-fold. That's the earnings power that Bhattacharya sees helping boost Supermicro too.In a client note, he wrote: ""We think this provider of server and storage solutions will be a beneficiary of AI-driven demand growth ... We believe the market for AI servers is much larger than is factored in [Wall] Street models.""Is it too late to buy Supermicro?Bhattacharya's price target could even be conservative. If the market for AI servers grows at a 50% annual rate over the next several years as Bhattacharya thinks, Supermicro has plenty more sales and earnings growth ahead.Yet the stock is still not overly expensive. It has a price-to-sales ratio of about 6 compared to 40 for Nvidia. And earnings could soar as they have for Nvidia. The analyst's call looks very achievable.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,The S&P 500 Just Did Something It Has Never Done Before. Wall Street Says the Stock Market Will Move Higher This Year.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-just-did-something-171500964.html,"The S&P 500 recently surpassed 5,000 points for the first time in history, but Wall Street analysts see more upside this year.","The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is designed to track the entire U.S. stock market. Specifically, the index measures the performance of 500 large U.S. companies that together account for a substantial portion of domestic equities as measured by market capitalization.The S&P 500 soared 24% last year as recession fears diminished, and it has advanced another 5% so far this year. Those gains carried the index above 5,000 points (the S&P 500 is measured in points, not dollars) for the first time last week. Very few investors would have predicted that rebound when the S&P 500 cratered at 3,577 in October 2022. But signs of economic resilience and excitement about artificial intelligence have been powerful tailwinds.There is nothing special about 5,000 points, per se, apart from the new record high. But Wall Street analysts see about 9% upside in the next 12 months. The S&P 500 carries a ""bottom-up"" target estimate of 5,452 points over the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That figure aggregates the median target price on every stock in the index, so it's based on about 11,500 different ratings. In other words, it starts at company-level estimates (the bottom) and moves up to build a target estimate for the entire index. But whether the stock market rises or falls in 2024 depends on a great many factors.Here's what investors should know.Wall Street expects S&P 500 revenue and earnings growth to accelerate in 2024The S&P 500 suffered three consecutive declines in quarterly earnings between the fourth quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2023. To elaborate, the sum of profits across the index divided by total shares outstanding provides an earnings per share figure for the entire index. That figure declined in three consecutive quarters. But profits rebounded in the second half of the year amid strong economic growth, and Wall Street expects that trend to continue in 2024.In fact, analysts project an acceleration in S&P 500 revenue and earnings growth this year, driven by particularly strong momentum across the technology and communication services sectors. The chart below compares actual growth in 2023 to projected growth in 2024 for S&P 500 ompanies.Story continuesMetric20232024Revenue Growth2.5%5.4%Earnings Growth0.9%10.9%Data source: FactSet Research. Growth percentages for 2024 are projections.If those consensus estimates prove correct, the acceleration in S&P 500 revenue and earnings growth could boost sentiment and send the stock market higher.However, analysts frequently revise their forecasts based on a constellation of microeconomic and macroeconomic factors. Indeed, first-quarter estimates have already been revised downward to some degree, but FactSet Research says those cuts have been smaller than average. In any case, investors should keep tabs on the companies in their portfolios, while also monitoring the broader economic backdrop.The U.S. economy gained steam in 2023, but momentum could slow in 2024The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to their highest level since 2001 to stamp out inflation. The rapid pace of those rate hikes drew recession warnings from economists last year, but the U.S. economy actually gained steam. Inflation cooled without a material uptick in unemployment, and gross domestic product (GDP) increased 2.5% in 2023, up from 1.9% in 2022.However, that acceleration in GDP was driven by government spending. Consumer spending and business investments actually decelerated last year, and both are expected to decelerate further this year. The World Bank estimates that U.S. economic growth will slow to 1.6% in 2024. Should economic expansion decelerate more sharply than anticipated, it would likely hamper corporate financial results, potentially putting downward pressure on the stock market.That said, economic growth could also come in above expectations if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in a meaningful way. The latest projections from policymakers imply three 25-basis-point rate cuts this year. But CME Group's FedWatch tool -- which uses pricing data from futures contracts to forecast monetary policy decisions -- shows a 50% chance that the Federal Reserve will implement at least five 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2024.In that latter scenario, business investments may increase more quickly than forecast, especially where technologies like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence are concerned. That could lead to more robust economic growth, which could send the stock market higher. Even if that doesn't happen, the secular tailwinds behind cybersecurity and artificial intelligence should create value for well-positioned investors over the long term.Patient investors have historically been well rewardedUltimately, whether the S&P 500 increases or decreases this year depends on market sentiment, which itself is governed by variables like corporate financial results and economic growth. Not even the smartest Wall Street analysts can predict those variables with absolute certainty, so investors should treat short-term forecasts with skepticism.A long-term mindset is the more prudent strategy. History makes it clear that patient investors are well rewarded over time. The S&P 500 has returned 1,800% over the last three decades, compounding at 10.3% annually. That period encompasses enough different market conditions that similar returns are likely over the next three decades. That does not mean the S&P 500 always goes up. The index has gone down and will continue to go down in certain years. But if growth during the last three decades was spread evenly across that 30-year period, the index would have increased at 10.3% annually.In that context, long-term investors can confidently put money into the stock market today. But they should always research companies before buying shares, and they should prioritize stocks that trade at reasonable valuations in the context of future growth prospects. Alternatively, making regular contributions to an S&P 500 index fund has historically been a winning strategy.Should you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is This 1 Thing the Biggest Risk for Uber Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-thing-biggest-risk-uber-170700701.html,"Despite the company's strong momentum, investors can't ignore the downside.","Uber (NYSE: UBER) gave investors a lot to cheer about when it reported its fourth-quarter financials. Revenue increased 15% year over year to $9.9 billion, while the company generated $1.4 billion in net income during those three months. Both of these headline figures crushed Wall Street consensus analyst estimates.In the last 12 months, shares of Uber have soared 102% (as of Feb. 12). And they recently hit a fresh all-time high.Before you rush to buy this transportation-as-a-service stock in the hope of riding the momentum to strong returns, take the time to understand what might be Uber's biggest risk. Let's take a closer look at the ride-hailing and delivery business.No more driversIn 2023, Uber completed a whopping 9.4 billion trips, which was up 24%, compared to the prior year. The business had 150 million monthly active platform consumers. Moreover, Uber handled roughly $138 billion of total gross bookings in the last 12 months. All of this not only speaks to the company's fantastic scale but also demonstrates just how successful and dominant Uber is currently.Despite the strong fundamentals, which seem to be making investors happy, there's a huge risk facing the business: autonomous-driving (AV) technology. It makes complete sense why AV tech could change Uber's entire business model. Drivers are the biggest cost of any ride or delivery. If there's a way to eliminate this expense, it could create a financial windfall for Uber.On the one hand, you would think that a business that relies so heavily on moving people and goods from place to place would be directly working on this initiative. But due to ongoing losses, coupled with heightened uncertainty as to when progress would be made, Uber sold its AV research division in December 2020. In my opinion, this move turned AV technology from a potential benefit to a major risk factor.Other companies have continued their efforts. Tesla and Alphabet's Waymo are two of the leading businesses when it comes to AV advancements. And they both have deep pockets to keep investing heavily.Story continuesIf fully autonomous-driving technology becomes a reality, it could disrupt the company because the owner of that software could launch its own robotaxi service. This is exactly what Tesla is trying to do. Its advantage comes from the massive amount of data it can collect from its vehicles.Uber has partnered with Waymo to provide driverless rides in the Phoenix area. But it's worrisome because the latter may be able to it create its own consumer-facing app in the future since it fully owns the underlying technology -- which is the most important aspect and the most difficult to develop. In this scenario, the actual vehicles will become commodities, and the businesses that can control the user experience and the software powering the cars will win. There's a possibility that this isn't going to be Uber.Don't ignore terminal riskAlthough Uber shares have been on a tear and currently sit just 3% below their all-time high, they trade at a price-to-sales multiple of 3.9. That's cheaper than the historical average of 4.4.Investors might view the current setup as an attractive buying opportunity. After all, Uber is the leader in its industry, it benefits from network effects, and it continues to turn a profit. It's easy to be bullish on the stock.But if this sounds like you, it's important not to forget the terminal risk of autonomous driving one day becoming a reality. Understanding this downside factor can help you set realistic expectations about what things might look like over the long term. So consider buying a smaller initial position until you feel more comfortable.Should you invest $1,000 in Uber Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Uber Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Uber Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Envious rivals whisper that Moelis has turned its Middle Eastern operation into one of the bank’s biggest revenue generators per employee — no mean feat in a part of the world that's not known for big fees.This all reflects the frenzy of dealmaking that’s gripped the Middle East while bankers elsewhere suffer a dearth of business. Gulf initial public offerings have raised more than $30 billion over the last two years, and Moelis — a minnow by Wall Street standards — has worked on more than half of those that hired independent financial advisers.That, bankers say, is the payoff for years of relationship building by its founder Ken Moelis. But it has also involved big compromises and risks. The Wall Street veteran chose to maintain his relationship with Saudi Arabia’s government in the aftermath of the 2018 killing of government critic Jamal Khashoggi. He’s also stuck through dramatic downturns in Dubai. More recently, the widening Israel-Hamas war has offered fresh reminders of the challenges of a region susceptible to political turbulence and frequent boom-and-bust cycles.Boutique banks like Moelis “can be more flexible in navigating different markets and taking hiring opportunities as they arise,” said George Traub, founder of Lumina Capital Advisers, a Dubai-based mid-market corporate adviser. But pricing in the risks of upheaval in the Gulf can also be particularly difficult, he said, “as non-linear outcomes are possible.”Story continuesBigger CompetitorsKen Moelis still sees the Middle East as crucial for his New York-based firm’s wider business and he will continue to focus on it, according to people familiar with the matter. It’s been sharply overshadowed by bigger competitors elsewhere. In Europe, it ranked No. 22 on M&A advisory last year, while in Asia Pacific, that ranking drops to No. 35. In all, the firm makes less than $1 billion in annual revenue globally — largely driven by its US business.Even though IPOs globally tumbled to their lowest level in more than a decade in 2023, the Middle East had one of its best years on record as governments racing to make their economies less oil reliant sold stakes in state-owned firms. The deals have continued despite the Israel-Hamas war, and the wealthiest Gulf countries have barely been affected.Ken Moelis, 65, has already stuck with the Middle East through thick and thin. In 2009, he boarded a plane to pitch for a $25 billion restructuring of state holding company Dubai World as it teetered on the brink of default. His firm ended up advising the government on the complex restructuring plan involving more than 70 creditors.That agreement cemented his reputation with some of the United Arab Emirates’ top officials and laid the foundations for more transactions.But he’s also made public relations outreaches that were harder for bigger banks to make because of their global profile.In October 2018, Ken Moelis and the firm’s Vice Chairman Eric Cantor stood out as two of the only top US financiers who attended Saudi Arabia’s flagship investment conference in Riyadh, just weeks after the murder of Khashoggi by government agents in the Saudi Arabian embassy in Turkey. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman denied involvement, but many businessmen and investors shunned the country in the wake of the brutal killing.Most of Moelis’s Wall Street peers, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and BlackRock Inc.’s boss Larry Fink, pulled out of the event amid the controversy. That move earned Moelis the trust of the kingdom’s top decision makers in a region known to reward loyalty, the people said.The firm has “built strong relationships with the region’s decision makers and has been involved in some landmark deals which put them on the map,” said Tom de Waele, Bain & Co Inc.’s managing partner for the Middle East. “Once you have established the right track record and level of trust with key decision makers, you see a fly wheel effect kicking in.”Biggest AdvisorThe bank is now one of the biggest global investment banking operations in the Middle East, with double the number of advisors than some bigger Wall Street competitors. Besides IPOs, it’s also active in regional M&A and advises firms that are conducting strategic reviews. Restructurings are another of its key offerings in the region.Despite its large footprint, the bank has only four managing directors in the region and relies heavily on a cadre of more junior executive directors, vice presidents and associates. The Middle East and North Africa office is led by Rami Touma, a former Credit Suisse banker, who is also a Harley Davidson aficionado.Moelis’s success in the Gulf is partly due to the commitment of its top US management, the people familiar with the matter said. Its founder and Cantor, a former US politician-turned banker, fly to the Middle East three-to-four times a year to pitch ideas. Their regular presence draws clients in a region where decisions are typically made by royals and a handful of top advisers, the people said.Still, fees in the region can sometimes be lower than expected. Moelis was among the banks that arranged Aramco’s $29 billion IPO in 2019. Analysts at the time predicted the offering could generate “tens of millions of dollars” in fees for Moelis, but in the end banks shared a fee pool of just over $100 million, an unusually small amount relative to the deal’s size.Moelis didn’t comment for this story and doesn’t disclose revenue from the Middle East, which are dwarfed by those from Europe and the Americas.Speaking at the 2018 event in Riyadh, Ken Moelis described relationships as a company’s most valuable asset — even if there’s no way to account for them on the balance sheet.Gulf leaders have welcomed Moelis’s loyalty. At the Qatar Economic Forum last May, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud greeted Ken as “my guy,” and praised him for being much better than the other bankers advising the kingdom on the Aramco IPO.At the same conference, the Wall Street veteran praised the Middle East’s ability to “make decisions, operate quickly, cut through the red tape, and lastly, think long term” without having “to deal with union problems.”“This is one of the few places in the world that’s actually making investments for the next five to 10 years,” he said.Regional BetsStill, Moelis’s first-mover advantage in the Middle East is being eroded as more and more rivals muscle in on the deal surge and the more than $2 trillion held by sovereign wealth funds. Rothschild & Co. has also been involved in landmark deals for years, rivaling Moelis in size and access to key clients. The boutique moved a senior equity capital markets banker to Dubai from Hong Kong in late 2022 to capture a bigger slice of the IPO boom. Advisory specialists from Lazard Ltd. to Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are also beefing up teams.The IPO market in the Gulf is relatively insulated from regional geopolitical risk, and in areas like local technology and services continues to be “a magnet for new growing companies that need capital,’’ said Karen Young, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.Since opening its hub in the Dubai International Financial Centre in 2011 and hiring JPMorgan veteran Yorick Van Slingelandt, Moelis’s regional business has grown from an eight-person team to a workforce of about 45.But not all of Moelis’s bets in the region have paid off. The company was involved in a number of deals involving special-purpose acquisition companies, most of which were pulled.Meanwhile, although rivals begrudgingly acknowledge Moelis’s success in the region, they also say it has sometimes operated more like a consultancy than an investment bank to win more lucrative work on big-ticket deals. It also charges a rolling fee for strategic advice — a model that’s fairly unique to the Middle East where rulers with grand ambitions surround themselves with consultants, according to executives.Last year, Moelis appointed Moaath Alangari to run its office in Riyadh after securing a license to operate in the kingdom, giving the firm a front-row seat to the crown prince’s ambitious plans.“The risks for boutiques like Moelis is that they’ve doubled down on Saudi Arabia and the region as one of their key growth markets, given the potential,” said Lumina’s Traub. “It would be interesting to see whether when deal activity picks up in 2024 across Europe and the US if that investment thesis is still valid and how the key resources are deployed.”--With assistance from Fareed Sahloul and Ben Bartenstein.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming WarsHow Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became ProfitableToday’s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear‘Playing God’: This Labor Activist’s Relentless Emails Force Companies to ChangeWhat’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,"Nvidia Just Bought This Under-the-Radar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. Should You Buy It, Too?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-just-bought-under-radar-164000543.html,Nvidia is spreading some of its enormous wealth across other areas of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the world's largest semiconductor company. It's worth a whopping $1.8 trillion, and over $1 trillion of that value was created in the last 12 months alone on the back of its next-generation data center chips designed to process artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.Now, Nvidia is spreading some of its newfound wealth across other areas of the AI industry. It filed a form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week, revealing the company held a number of investments in other AI companies.SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) is one of them, and its stock soared 67% on the day Nvidia's investment was revealed. The company is worth just shy of $1 billion as of this writing, but its voice-based AI technologies are incredibly innovative and have the potential to create substantially more value. Here's why investors might want to follow Nvidia's lead and buy SoundHound AI stock.Image source: Getty Images.SoundHound is a leader in conversational AIYou might be familiar with the generative AI chatbot ChatGPT, which was developed by OpenAI. It can answer complex questions and turn text-based prompts into blog posts, images, videos, and even computer code. SoundHound AI, on the other hand, develops conversational AI, which is designed to recognize voice-based prompts and respond in kind.SoundHound says its technology can process speech just like the human brain. It has enormous potential in consumer-facing applications, and some of the world's largest companies have already adopted it. Restaurant chains are using SoundHound to answer phones, automate drive-thru ordering, and assist employees with their routine tasks. Jersey Mike's, White Castle, and Krispy Kreme are just some of the restaurant giants using the technology.SoundHound also partnered with restaurant technology providers like Block's Square, Toast, and Olo. They have integrated conversational AI into their point-of-sale and ordering systems so customers can seamlessly use voice to make purchases. Those integrations are helping SoundHound rapidly expand into tens of thousands of new locations.Story continuesAutomotive giants are also using SoundHound to create highly sophisticated in-car voice assistants. They can do everything from helping the driver navigate their vehicle's features to answering questions about the weather, sports results, and even local restaurant availability. Hyundai, Kia, and Stellantis (Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge) are just a few of the car manufacturers using SoundHound AI right now.2023 was SoundHound's biggest year everSoundHound will report its financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 in a few weeks. Wall Street analysts are forecasting $46.5 million in total revenue for the year, which would represent 49% growth compared to 2022.While it appears SoundHound is pulling in relatively modest sales for a $1 billion company, the company has amassed a whopping $341.7 million order backlog as Sept. 30, which it's currently working through. Those orders are expected to convert into revenue over time.Plus, SoundHound delivered just $6.7 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2023, yet management is guiding for $16 million to $20 million of revenue in the fourth quarter. The company is rapidly scaling.SoundHound AI isn't the only bet Nvidia recently madeAccording to Nvidia's 13F filing for the fourth quarter of 2023, it purchased 1,730,883 shares in SoundHound AI. It doesn't specify what price Nvidia paid, but the position is worth $6.5 million at SoundHound's current stock price of $3.76.SoundHound wasn't the only stock Nvidia bought during Q4. It accumulated 1,960,784 shares in semiconductor designer Arm Holdings, which are worth over $260 million at the current price. Nvidia also bought a stake in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, worth $95 million at today's price.Nano-X Imaging and Tusimple Holdings are the two other stocks Nvidia purchased.Each of these companies is using AI and autonomous technologies in some capacity.Should you follow Nvidia into SoundHound AI stock?Nvidia's $6.5 million position doesn't say much about SoundHound's future potential. However, the fact Nvidia identified SoundHound amid a growing field of AI opportunities does make you wonder what the chip giant is seeing.Financially speaking, SoundHound was on the brink of running out of money just a year ago, before it secured a $125 million loan facility from Atlas Credit Partners. SoundHound continues to lose money, but that cash infusion should be enough to see the company through the next 12 months (at least) assuming its losses don't grow any larger.It does make SoundHound stock a relatively risky play, and it's no surprise it's incredibly volatile. Its 52-week low is $1.49 and its 52-week high is $5.11, which is a very wide spread.Generative AI is a significant opportunity, and SoundHound has already amassed an impressive list of customers. Plus, its order backlog should result in strong revenue growth for at least the next couple of years. It might be worth following Nvidia's lead by taking a small position in SoundHound AI stock, but investors should brace themselves for a volatile ride.Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Warren Buffett-Led Berkshire Hathaway Sells Some Apple Stock. Should You?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-led-berkshire-hathaway-163000891.html,"Buffett loves Apple's relentless stock buybacks, and so should you.","On Feb. 14, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) filed its 13F report for the period ended Dec. 31, 2023. There weren't too many sizable moves, but one noticeable one was that Berkshire sold around 10 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), trimming the position by a little over 1%.Let's discuss Berkshire's stake in Apple, what Berkshire's moves could indicate about its thoughts on the market, and what you should do if you own or want to buy the tech stock.Image source: Getty Images.Berkshire's evolving Apple positionBerkshire began acquiring Apple stock in 2016. By the end of 2018, Berkshire had racked up just shy of 1 billion shares. As of the end of 2023, Berkshire held 905.6 million shares.Apple has become Berkshire's largest holding because the buying spree between 2016 and 2018 proved to be a genius move. Apple stock is up 366.6% between the end of 2018 and Feb. 14. Berkshire sold 93.5 million shares in 2020. But aside from that, the position has remained relatively unchanged.Even after the fourth-quarter 2023 sale, Apple remains 45.5% of Berkshire's public equity portfolio, with Berkshire owning 5.9% of the company.What the move could signalI have two key takeaways from Berkshire's decision to keep its Apple position mostly unchanged between 2021 and 2023.The first is that Berkshire doesn't have better ideas than Apple. If it did, it could divert its enormous profits from Apple stock elsewhere. Effectively, Berkshire doesn't have a good enough alternative idea to justify selling Apple stock and suffering the associated tax consequences.The second takeaway is that Berkshire views Apple as a good value, not necessarily as a growth stock.Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett is a value investor at heart, and Berkshire's overall portfolio is incredibly value-oriented. The top five holdings in its public equity portfolio are Apple, Bank of America, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Chevron. Outside of its public equity portfolio, the most valuable assets Berkshire owns are its property and casualty insurance business, its 100% ownership of BNSF railroad, its 92% ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and several stakes or partial stakes in other companies.Story continuesBerkshire isn't the kind of company to go out and ride the hot trend, like artificial intelligence (AI) today or the metaverse a few years ago. It's also not the kind of company to change its investment strategy.In its 2023 annual shareholder meeting from last May, Warren Buffett praised Apple, saying the following:Our criteria for Apple isn't different than the other businesses we own, it just happens to be a better business than any we own and we put a fair amount of money in it but we haven't got more money in it than we've got in the railroad. Our railroad is a very good business but it's not remotely as good as Apple's business.In other words, Apple doesn't get preferential treatment over other companies, it just continues to check all of the boxes. A couple of minutes later in the meeting, Buffett said: ""I made a mistake a couple years ago and I sold some shares."" What he's referring to are the 93.5 million shares sold in the second half of 2020 that we discussed earlier. Buffett defended it by saying some tax-related factors made the move advisable, but he still seemed to regret it.So, if Buffett said that selling Apple was a mistake, you may wonder why Berkshire sold a little over 10 million shares in Q4 2023. Since it is a relatively small amount, my guess is that this may have been tax-related. We will hear more about Buffett's opinions on Apple during Berkshire's 2024 annual meeting on May 4. If I had to guess, the investment thesis on Apple hasn't changed.Apple's ace in the holeBerkshire is a big believer in the power of stock buybacks, but only if the business is good. This is why Berkshire famously doesn't pay a dividend, preferring instead to repurchase its own stock. Dividends are ""double taxed"" because they are paid with income that is taxed to the company and then taxed again when distributed to shareholders. Buybacks can be a better use of capital because they avoid this double taxing problem. They also reduce the outstanding share count of a company, which boosts earnings per share (EPS) and makes each existing share own a higher percentage of the company.Over the last 10 years, Berkshire has reduced its outstanding share count by 12.2%, whereas Apple has reduced its share count by 36%. Buybacks continue to be the main driver of Apple's capital return program. In its recent quarter, Apple spent $20.1 billion on buybacks and $3.8 billion on dividends.It's no secret that Apple's top- and bottom-line growth has slowed. The stock is also down 4.5% year to date, compared to a 5.5% gain in the S&P 500. Buybacks help boost EPS when organic growth is slow. Buffett and his team don't seem too concerned about Apple's current slowdown or its valuation. After all, there are aspects of the business that are thriving -- namely, the high-margin services segment, which just set a record for operating income and revenue.A foundational holdingBerkshire's decision to leave its Apple position mostly unchanged makes sense. The company isn't exhibiting the growth to make it a screaming buy. Unlike other big tech stocks, Apple has yet to make a meaningful splash with AI, namely because it doesn't have the business-to-business AI potential of a company like Nvidia or Microsoft.Apple is a well-run business that is missing out on the market rally for a good reason. There doesn't seem to be any real reason to pile into Apple stock now. However, if the broader market continues to become more expensive (and Apple languishes), it will begin to look like a better value. Apple is a stock worth putting on the top of a watchlist or buying a starter position in if you don't own any. The stock is out of favor on Wall Street right now compared to other big tech plays, but that could change quickly if fundamentals improve or the valuation comes down.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,3 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-millionaire-maker-technology-stocks-162300929.html,"Snowflake, DigitalOcean, and Wolfspeed could be multibaggers for long-term investors.","Many growth-oriented investors adore tech companies because they can often expand for years by disrupting legacy industries. The sector's biggest success stories -- including Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- made their long-term investors into millionaires by constantly expanding their ecosystems and crushing their competitors.Those tech giants could still generate more millionaire-making gains, but investors looking for those types of opportunities should also keep an eye on some smaller companies that are often overshadowed by their larger or flashier peers. I personally believe three of those smaller tech stocks -- Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW), DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN), and Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF) -- also have the potential to mint new millionaires over the next few decades.Image source: Getty Images.1. SnowflakeSnowflake helps companies collect data from a wide range of computing platforms, cleans it all up, and stores it in a centralized data warehouse that can be easily accessed by third-party data-visualization applications. That approach breaks down silos across an organization and makes it easier for managers to make data-driven decisions.Snowflake competes against Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet, which all integrate similar data warehouses into their own cloud infrastructure platforms. But Snowflake doesn't operate its own cloud infrastructure, which makes it compatible with a wide range of public cloud platforms, and it charges usage-based fees instead of locking its customers into sticky subscriptions. That flexibility makes it an appealing option for companies that don't want to be tethered to a bigger cloud ecosystem.That strategy is paying off. From its fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2023 (which ended Jan. 31, 2023), Snowflake's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 98%. It expects its product revenue -- which accounts for most of its top line -- to grow at a CAGR of 32% from $1.9 billion in fiscal 2023 to $10 billion in fiscal 2029.Story continuesTrading at 21 times next year's expected sales, Snowflake's stock isn't cheap, but the company's rapid growth, high retention rates, and rising margins could justify that premium valuation and make it a millionaire-maker stock for long-term investors.2. DigitalOceanDigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure services provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. But unlike those cloud giants, which mainly serve large enterprise customers, DigitalOcean carves out tiny ""droplets"" of its servers for use by smaller companies. It also recently opened up its platform for AI applications by acquiring the AI-oriented cloud start-up Paperspace and installing Nvidia's high-end data center graphics processing units (GPUs) in its servers.The bears claimed DigitalOcean would struggle to grow in the shadow of its larger peers, but its revenue grew at a CAGR of 35% from 2020 to 2022 -- and analysts expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 15% from 2022 to 2025.DigitalOcean's revenue growth is gradually cooling off, but its stock looks cheap at just four times next year's sales. Its margins are also expanding, and it's expected to generate its first full-year profit in 2023. Analysts expect its earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 119% from 2023 to 2025, so it could have plenty of room to run before it saturates its niche market. It could also become a compelling takeover target for one of the cloud infrastructure leaders.3. WolfspeedWolfspeed, the chipmaker previously known as Cree, produces wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors made from silicon carbide and gallium nitride, which can operate at higher voltages, temperatures, and frequencies than traditional silicon chips. Those qualities make WBG chips well-suited for use in short-length LEDs, lasers, 5G base stations, and military radars. They're also used to build batteries and powertrains for electric vehicles.The global WBG device market could grow at a CAGR of 29.4% from 2022 to 2031, according to a forecast by Business Research Insights, as WBG chips replace silicon chips across a wide range of industries. To capitalize on that long-term growth, Wolfspeed opened the world's largest 200mm silicon carbide plant in upstate New York in 2022.Wolfspeed's revenue rose at a CAGR of 32% from 2021 to 2023, but it's expected to decline by 9% in 2024 as the global electric vehicle (EV) market slows down. At the same time, its costs are climbing as it ramps up the expansion of its New York plant. That mix of slowing growth and rising expenses rattled the bulls, but analysts still expect its revenue to increase at a CAGR of 25% from 2023 to 2026 as it bounces back from that cyclical downturn.Wolfspeed isn't profitable yet, but its stock looks cheap at 4 times next year's sales. Therefore, it might generate millionaire-making gains for long-term investors who stay focused on the growth potential of the WBG market.Should you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?Before you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Snowflake wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,1 Stock and 2 Funds That Could Create Lasting Generational Wealth,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-2-funds-could-160600334.html,A diversified investment strategy with long-term growth potential... in three tickers.,"Sure, buying and selling stocks can be fun, but isn't creating lasting wealth, generational wealth that can be passed to your descendants, the goal? And that can be an elusive goal as the market goes up and down over time, as do share prices. Sometimes, things go sideways and we have a market crash, from which some stocks never recover.So, how can investors give their portfolios the best chance at standing the test of time? Diversification is the answer. Simply put, don't put too many eggs in one basket. Investors can build a portfolio with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that owns shares of many businesses and with individual stocks of diverse businesses that have proven they can perform over the long haul.Consider tucking these three into your portfolio. Decades from now, you might be glad you did.1. Invest your money with Warren BuffettInvesting great Warren Buffett has built his legacy through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), an investing empire carrying an $860 billion market cap today. The reality is that Buffett, 93, won't be around decades from now. However, Berkshire is built with staying power, arguably unmatched by any company on Wall Street.For starters, Berkshire owns many private companies across various industries. Some of Berkshire's well-known consumer-facing companies include GEICO Insurance, Duracell, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom, and Clayton Homes. Additionally, Berkshire owns a sprawling collection of industrial assets, including railroads, oil and gas pipelines, and utilities. If that wasn't enough, Berkshire has a portfolio of public companies worth over $370 billion, and an additional $157 billion in cash.BRK.A Total Return Price ChartThese many assets generate earnings and investment income, which all flow to Berkshire's cash hoard, deployed as Buffett and his management group see fit. Berkshire Hathaway stock doesn't pay a dividend, but it has allocated its resources well enough to outperform the S&P 500 as an investment for years. Berkshire is one of the few stocks you can buy and forget, because your money is tied up in a sprawling business built to last forever.Story continues2. Don't fight the market, join itMany invest to beat the market, i.e., outperform the S&P 500 index, probably the most common investing benchmark. But frankly, it's tough to do that consistently. Buffett himself recommends investing in index funds that hold shares of all the companies in the S&P 500. For a lot of investors, it makes sense to ride the S&P 500 by investing in an ETF like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).The S&P 500 represents 500 of the most prominent U.S. companies. It's not a static list, either. A better business will replace a company that falls off. In other words, it's a turn-key portfolio of the best companies in the world's most prolific economy. Will things get dicey sometimes? Sure. Bear markets, which involve drops of at least 20% from highs, happen a couple of times a decade.^SPX ChartBut whether it's a recession, war, or a global pandemic roiling the broader market, the S&P 500 has always rebounded and grown to new highs. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has done a great job tracking it, and for a tiny 0.03% expense ratio.3. Diversify into big tech with a single ETFBig technology companies are driving new industries like cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). That's been underlined by the performance of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, which have collectively run circles around the broader market. But instead of trying to predict which of these stocks will get hot (and when), consider the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ) instead. This ETF focuses on big technology and innovation stocks.The ""Magnificent Seven"" are littered throughout the Invesco QQQ's top holdings. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Alphabet comprise 40% of the fund's holdings. Big technology's growth has led to stellar fund performance in recent years against all three primary U.S. stock market benchmarks.QQQ ChartThis doesn't guarantee that the outperformance will last. Still, AI could grow into a multitrillion-dollar industry, and these colossal technology companies have the deep pockets to invest and grab that opportunity by the horns. Having long-term and diversified exposure via the Invesco QQQ is a simple way to ensure that your portfolio is exposed to that upside.Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is Roku the Best Streaming Stock to Buy Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-best-streaming-stock-buy-152000617.html,Investors have their eyes on Roku stock after the latest earnings report.,"Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) recently reported its financial results for the last three months of 2023. And based on how shares are performing, investors weren't pleased with the numbers. Revenue was better than expected, but management warned of ongoing industry headwinds this year.The latest update proves again that Roku is dealing with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. And this will continue to impact the digital advertising market in the near term.Nonetheless, the business is still well positioned to gain from the growing number of cord-cutters. But is Roku the best streaming stock to buy right now? Let's take a closer look.Top streaming platformThe best way to understand Roku's business model is to think of it as a three-sided platform, consisting of viewers, content providers, and advertisers. Viewers use the service as a way to enjoy all of their favorite movies and TV shows in one elegant interface. And advertisers who want to target a large, highly-engaged streaming audience can do so with Roku. While the company does generate revenue from the sale of its hardware devices, including smart TVs and media sticks, the vast majority of its top line comes from the platform segment. This advertising and subscription revenue made up 86% of the total in 2023. With the leading smart-TV operating system in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, Roku has 80 million active accounts that streamed 29.1 billion hours of content last quarter. What places Roku in an advantageous position is that it can ride the wave of streaming entertainment, while other companies spend tens of billions of dollars to produce this content. And as marketing dollars transition from traditional cable TV to connected TV, the business will benefit from greater digital advertising spend as well.Shares have soared 77% since the beginning of 2023, but they're still 85% below their all-time high. They also trade at a price-to-sales multiple of 2.9, just a fraction of the historical average of 10.1. This beaten-down valuation helps support the argument that Roku might be the best way to play the streaming trend.Story continuesTop streaming serviceHowever, investors can't ignore the dominant force in the industry: Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). After adding a better-than-expected 13.1 million net new subscribers last quarter, the company now has more than 260 million paying customers. This makes Netflix the largest streaming service on the planet with 2023 revenue totaling $33.7 billion.I mentioned above how Roku largely avoids the massive spending that other streaming companies have to deal with. While it's true Netflix plans to spend a whopping $17 billion on content this year after shelling out the same amount in 2023, this company has an advantage thanks to its huge scale. Netflix has no problem spending this much money year in and year out because its user base is so big.Management expects Netflix to report an operating margin of 24% in 2024 with free cash flow expected to total $6 billion. This puts the business in a league of its own in terms of financial strength. The success of paid sharing initiatives and the new ad-based tier are already supporting improved growth, and this can lead to even greater profitability over time.This direct-to-consumer streaming service, which is dominating the industry, also qualifies as a top streaming stock. In other words, investors who want more exposure to this secular trend could consider owning shares of both Netflix and Roku.Should you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?Before you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"2 Best ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks to Buy in February",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-best-magnificent-seven-stocks-151100710.html,These best-of-breed companies offer near-term growth catalysts and remain attractively valued.,"The returns of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have trounced the returns of the growth-centric Nasdaq Composite index over the last year, and they continue to do so in 2024. Year to date, the group has returned 12.4%, almost doubling the Nasdaq's returns, based on the performance of the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF.Among this elite group of tech stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are showing solid business growth and still offer upside from their recent highs. Here's why these two Magnificent Seven stocks remain solid picks right now.NvidiaNvidia has been one of the best stocks to ride the growth in artificial intelligence (AI), as its share price soared by 239% over the last 12 months. The good news for investors late to the party is that its skyrocketing growth may have a while to play out. The stock remains attractively valued relative to its underlying business growth, and it's still one of the best AI stocks to buy for a few reasons.One technique for getting a read on end-market demand for a company's products is to look at what other companies with adjacent businesses are reporting. Super Micro Computer makes plug-and-play rack systems for data centers, which include Nvidia's GPUs.Supermicro reported that its revenue grew 103% year over year in the most recent quarter as demand grew for AI rack solutions based on Nvidia's H100 chip. This was a massive acceleration over Supermicro's previous quarter and suggests demand for Nvidia's chips is not slowing down.Analysts are raising their annual revenue estimates for Nvidia for the next few years, even though growth expectations were already sky-high for the GPU leader. The stock's modest valuation still makes Nvidia an attractive stock to buy. It currently trades at 35 times next year's consensus earnings estimate, which looks reasonable given Nvidia's robust growth.There is $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure to fuel Nvidia's growth for a long time.Story continuesThe emergence of AI is forcing more companies to adopt accelerated computing and invest in GPUs, which is why Nvidia is seeing such tremendous growth. It generates $32 billion in trailing revenue from its data center segment, and given its estimated 80% market share in the AI chip market, it is well positioned to deliver more growth and returns for investors.AmazonAmazon is an incredibly strong business that has multiple revenue streams to drive returns for shareholders, including cloud services, advertising, and online retail sales. While its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services, gets most of the attention on Wall Street, it's the company's improving growth in e-commerce that is driving the stock higher.Some might argue that AI technology could make it easier for consumers to search the web and find the products they want at other retailers, which could hurt Amazon in the long run. However, this underestimates the human tendency to stick with trusted brands. It also overlooks the investments Amazon is making in AI and infrastructure to improve its retail service.Amazon is in the process of boosting its delivery speed, which will make it more difficult for competitors to catch up. It said it achieved the fastest delivery speeds in its history in 2023, with over 7 billion units arriving the same or next day.One benefit of faster delivery is more frequent shopping behavior. Amazon's online sales growth accelerated every quarter last year, but the company's profits are also up thanks to cost cuts and improved inventory efficiency.AMZN Net Income (Quarterly) ChartAI will only make Amazon's brand stronger. Many customers visit Amazon.com almost by default instead of searching for products on Google, and Amazon is about to push its value proposition further with the launch of Rufus, a new shopping assistant powered by generative AI.Amazon's improving shipping speed and opportunities to enhance the shopping experience with new AI tools will protect its competitive moat. Meanwhile, the stock still trades at a fair valuation of about 3.1 times trailing revenue, which is within its 10-year trading range. This means that as the company's e-commerce business recovers, the stock could deliver market-beating gains over the next few years.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.
