The Nifty50 made a healthy attempt on February 7 but failed to defend the 22,000 mark due to selling pressure in late morning deals and remained rangebound in the rest of the session. Hence, unless the index gives a strong closing above 21,970, the sustained uptrend towards a record high of 22,126 is unlikely in coming sessions, while the 21,750-21,700 is expected to be immediate support for the index, experts said.
